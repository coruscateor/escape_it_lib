# Escape It Lib

A library for converting Strings with characters that are represented by escaped characters in code such as \n and \t into Strings where these escape character sequences have literally been added in place of where their non-escaped versions were located in the provided input String.

Un-escaping has not yet been implemented.

## Todo:

- Add an object that caches string output. 
- Add code examples
- implement un-escaping

## Coding Style

The coding style of this project emphasises the use of white space over keeping the line and column counts low.

So this:

```rust
fn foo()
{

    bar();

}

```

Not this:

```rust
fn foo()
{
    bar();
}

```
